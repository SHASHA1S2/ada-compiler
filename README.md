============
This is a part of CS335:Compilers course at IITK.
We have to implement these features:
* types and subtypes
* constrained and unconstrained types
* dynamic types
* conditional:if-else,case with others(like default in C)
* Unconditional:goto,return
* loops:for ,while_loop, until_loop, exit_loop, array_loop
* Integer types,Unsigned Integer types,Enumerations ( operators and attributes,enum,literals, Boolean and characters as enum literals ,enum subtypes,floating point types,fixed point types (ordinary as well as decimal)
* Arrays :with known subranges, with unknown subranges, with aliased elements,multidimensional arrays ,using arrays(assignment,concatenate,array attributes,null
arrays)
* records:types of records are basic,tagged,null, discriminated,
abstract tagged, limited,variant and union,with aliased elements
* All access types and their usage, limited types
* IO:text, direct, stream, sequential and storage
* Exceptions:predefined,IO,raising an exception.
